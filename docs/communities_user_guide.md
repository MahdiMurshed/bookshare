# Communities User Guide

Welcome to BookShare Communities! This guide will help you get started with creating, joining, and managing communities to share books with specific groups.

## What are Communities?

Communities are groups where you can share books with specific people who share your interests. Whether it's your book club, university campus, neighborhood, or interest-based group (like Sci-Fi lovers), communities help you organize and share books with the right people.
