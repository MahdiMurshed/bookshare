description: Polish UI components using the frontend-design skill
---

Use the frontend-design skill to polish and enhance the UI component or page that the user has described or referenced.

Focus on:
- Creating distinctive, production-grade interfaces
- High design quality that avoids generic AI aesthetics
- Clean, polished code following the project's patterns
- Responsive design with proper spacing and typography
- Accessibility best practices
- Consistent use of shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS 4
- Following the naming conventions and code standards from CLAUDE.md

If the user hasn't specified what to polish, ask them to clarify which component, page, or UI element they want to enhance.
