description: Write end-to-end tests using Playwright
---

Use the playwright-skill to write comprehensive end-to-end tests for the specified feature, page, or user flow.

Focus on:
- Testing complete user journeys and interactions
- Auto-detecting dev servers and writing clean test scripts
- Testing forms, navigation, authentication flows
- Validating UI elements and user experience
- Checking responsive design and accessibility
- Following Playwright best practices
- Writing maintainable, readable test code

If the user hasn't specified what to test, ask them to clarify which feature, page, or user flow they want to test.

Common test scenarios:
- Authentication flows (sign in, sign up, sign out)
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete books)
- Form submissions and validations
- Navigation between pages
- Search and filtering functionality
- Error handling and edge cases
